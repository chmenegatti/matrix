## 📍 Overview

The matrix codebase is a terminal screensaver that displays a matrix animation, offering users an aesthetically pleasing visual experience. This project utilizes the crossterm library to manipulate the terminal, update the animation in a loop, and print randomly positioned characters in green color on a black background. With its simple yet captivating functionality, it provides a delightful way to personalize one's terminal and enjoy an immersive visual display.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a simple architecture where the main.rs file contains the code for the terminal screensaver. It uses the crossterm library for terminal manipulation and animation. The animation is updated in a loop for continuous display. The codebase is structured in a single file, which may limit modularity and maintainability.   |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. Only a brief description of the main.rs file is provided in the repository. The lack of detailed documentation makes it more challenging for developers to understand and contribute to the project.   |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on the crossterm library for terminal manipulation and animation. The dependency can be found in the Cargo.toml file and can be installed using Cargo, the package manager for Rust.   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is not highly modular. All the code is contained within a single file, which may make it difficult to maintain and extend the system. Breaking down the code into smaller, interchangeable components would improve modularity and code organization.   |
| **✔️ Testing**          | The codebase does not have any built-in testing strategies or tools. There are no unit tests or integration tests included. The lack of testing makes it difficult to ensure the correctness and stability of the system. Implementing testing frameworks like Rust's built-in testing library or external testing libraries would be beneficial.   |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | The system's performance is dependent on the underlying hardware and the efficiency of the crossterm library. Since there are no performance-specific optimizations in the codebase, it is challenging to quantify the performance of the system accurately. However, the system's performance is expected to be reasonable, as it only involves displaying a matrix animation in the terminal.   |
| **🔐 Security**        | The codebase does not explicitly address security measures. As a simple screensaver, it does not handle sensitive data or access external systems, reducing the security risks. However, it is always recommended to follow secure coding practices and adhere to security guidelines when developing software.   |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase is hosted on GitHub, indicating the use of Git for version control. The repository allows for easy collaboration, issue tracking, and version history. Developers can clone, branch, and merge the codebase using Git tools. However, details about specific version control strategies or practices are not available in the repository.   |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The codebase does not integrate with other systems or services. It is a self-contained screensaver for terminal usage and does not interact with external APIs or databases.   |
| **📶 Scalability**     | The codebase does not exhibit

| [main.rs](https://github.com/chmenegatti/matrix.git/blob/main/src/main.rs) | This code snippet is a simple terminal screensaver that displays a matrix animation. It uses the crossterm library to manipulate the terminal, clear the screen, and print characters in random positions with green color on a black background. The animation is constantly updated in a loop. |
